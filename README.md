# Taxi Fare Prediction Using Machine Learning and Big Data

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes 400,000+ taxi trip records to predict fares, identify high-demand locations, and optimize taxi service operations using machine learning and big data techniques.

## 🎯 Key Achievements
- Achieved 90.8% R² accuracy in fare prediction using Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Processed 400,000+ records using distributed computing
- Identified top 10 high-demand pickup locations for fleet optimization
- Built automated data pipeline with cloud storage integration

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Cloud Storage**: Azure Blob Storage
- **Big Data Processing**: Apache Spark (PySpark)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Machine Learning**: Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBT)
- **Programming**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## 📈 Results
- **RMSE**: 6.49
- **R² Score**: 0.908
